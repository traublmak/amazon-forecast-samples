# Amazon Forecast No-code-workshop
*No code workshop to experiment on Amazon Forecast*

Introduction: Amazon Forecast is a machine learning service that provides prediction based on time series data provided by AWS.

## Region selection
Please check with your instructor about the regions where you will be working for this hands-on. In this lab we should use **US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1** region. You can change it by selecting the region name in the upper right of the screen:

![Region selection](pictures/region_selection.png "Region selection")
 
## Download data for learning
[This CSV file](data/electricityusagedata.csv) includes power consumption data for individual households. Here's a snippet of this file:
 
![Data snippet](pictures/data_snippet.png "Data snippet")

In this hands-on workshop, future power consumption will be predicted based on this time series data. Amazon Forecast can process any time series data, so sales data, inventory consumption data, etc. can also be used.

## Creating an S3 bucket
Amazon Forecast imports the training data from any S3 bucket: let's create one to store the CSV file downloaded earlier.

1. Access the S3 management console by typing S3 as shown below:

![Access S3 console](pictures/console_s3.png)
 
2. Press **Create Bucket**

![Create S3 Bucket](pictures/s3_create_bucket.png)

3. Enter an appropriate name in **Bucket Name**

The S3 bucket must have a reasonably long name because it must be unique across all AWS users. Specify the same region as the region in which you will be working on Amazon Forecast.

![Create S3 Bucket Dialog Box](pictures/s3_create_bucket_dialog.png)

Click the **Create** button on the bottom right of this dialog box to create an S3 buckets with default parameters.

4. Click on the name of the created bucket

![Created bucket](pictures/s3_bucket_created.png)

5. Press **Upload**

![Upload file to bucket](pictures/s3_upload.png)

6. Select `electricityusagedata.csv` downloaded earlier by dragging and dropping the file or by clicking the **Add files** button.

![Select file to upload](pictures/s3_upload_selected.png)

7. Click the **Upload** button at the bottom left of the screen to start uploading.

8. The following screen will be displayed when the upload is completed.

![Upload completed](pictures/s3_upload_completed.png)

## Creating an IAM role
Create the required permissions for Forecast to access S3. The permissions created here will be attached to Forecast later and you will be able to access S3.

1. Access the IAM management console in the same way as S3.

![Navigating to IAM console](pictures/console_iam.png)

![IAM Landing page](pictures/iam_landing_page.png)

2. Select **Roles** in the navigation pane on the left side of the screen.

![IAM Create Role](pictures/iam_create_role.png)

3. Click the **Create role** button

![IAM Forecast role step 1](pictures/iam_step1.png)

4. Select **Forecast** from **Choose a service to view is use cases** and press **Next: Permissions**.

![IAM Forecast role step 2](pictures/iam_step2.png)

5. Press **Next** at the bottom right of the screen.

![IAM Forecast role step 3](pictures/iam_step3.png)

6. Enter an appropriate name in **Role Name** and press **Create Role**.

![IAM Forecast role created](pictures/iam_role_created.png)

7. Creation is complete. Click on the created role to go to the details screen. Make a note of **Role ARN** because we will associate this role to Forecast later and grand S3 access to the service:

![IAM Forecast role summary](pictures/iam_role_summary.png)

## Go to the Forecast screen in the same way as S3 and IAM.

![Forecast Console Access](pictures/console_forecast.png)

1. Click on **View dataset groups** button on the welcome screen:

![Forecast Landing Page](pictures/forecast_landing_page.png)

Then, press **Create dataset group** on the interface below: a dataset group is a collection of complimentary datasets that detail a set of changing parameters over a series of time. After creating a dataset group, you use it to train one or more predictors.

![Forecast Dataset Group](pictures/forecast_dataset_group.png)

2. Enter an appropriate name in **Dataset group name**, set **Forecasting domain** to **Custom** and press **Next**. A *dataset domain* specifies a pre-defined dataset schema for a common use case, and does not impact model algorithms or hyperparameters.

![Forecast Dataset Group Step 1](pictures/forecast_dataset_group_step1.png)

3. Enter an appropriate name in **Dataset name**. Select **hour** for **Frequency of your data**: this value must match the time series interval of the original data to be learned.

![Forecast Target Dataset](pictures/forecast_target_dataset_step2.png)

4. To match the value of **Data Schema** to the order of the original data to be trained on, replace the data schema by the following value:

```json
{
  "Attributes": [
    {
      "AttributeName": "timestamp",
      "AttributeType": "timestamp"
    },
    {
      "AttributeName": "target_value",
      "AttributeType": "float"
    },
    {
      "AttributeName": "item_id",
      "AttributeType": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

5. Fill **Dataset import details** part

Enter an appropriate name in **Dataset import name**. 

Enter the source data for learning that you uploaded earlier in **Data location** (file _electricityusagedata.csv_)

Paste the newly created IAM Role ARN that you copied in **Custom IAM role ARN**.

![Forecast Target Dataset](pictures/forecast_import_target_dataset.png)

6. Press **Start**

7. If the following green bar is displayed, the dataset is set correctly:

![Forecast import successful](pictures/forecast_dataset_created.png)

8. Import will start. You can go in created Dataset group _AmazonForecastWorkshopDatasetGroup_ and the following screen will appear:

![Forecast import dataset pending](pictures/forecast_import_dataset_pending.png)

9. The import is complete when **Active** is displayed in green as shown below. Note that each dataset group can have up to three datasets, one of each dataset type: target time series (like the one we just created), related time series, and item metadata.

![Forecast import dataset active](pictures/forecast_import_dataset_active.png)

## Learning
Now that the data has been imported, we can start learning a new model from these data. In Amazon Forecast, we do this by creating a new predictor:

![Predictor Start](pictures/predictor_start.png)

1. Press **Start** in the **Train a predictor** section:

![Predictor Start](pictures/predictor_name.png)

2. Enter an appropriate name in Predictor name. **Forecast horizon** is the time interval for forecasting. In this hands-on, enter **36** to create a forecast of 36-intervals long (for 36 hours in this case):

**Forecast frequency** must be the same as the original data, so select **hour**. Leave default Forecast quantiles.

![Predictor Continue](pictures/predictor_details.png)

3. Leave **Enable AutoPredictor** as **On** and select **Optimization metric** for **Default**.
(You can unselect AutoPredictor and explore the list of algorithms that available for training)
![Predictor Continue](pictures/predictor_details_2.png)

4. Leave other fileds as default.

5. Press **Train predictor** with all remaining values unchanged.

![Predictor Train](pictures/predictor_train.png)

6. Learning has started when the following message is displayed:

![Predictor Pending](pictures/predictor_pending.png)

6. Learning is completed when **Active** is displayed as shown below:

![Predictor Active](pictures/predictor_active.png)

## Creating a prediction endpoint
Now that learning is done, let's create an endpoint to request some predictions:

![Forecast start](pictures/generate_forecast_start.png)

1. Click the **Start** button next to the **Generate forecasts** section on the right side of the screen.
 
2．　Enter an appropriate name in **Forecast name**. From the **Predictor** dropdown, select the name you gave to the model trained earlier:

![Forecast details](pictures/generate_forecast_details.png)
 
3. Press the **Create a forecast** button.
 
4. This will take some time, as the prediction endpoint will start:

![Forecast pending](pictures/generate_forecast_pending.png)

5. The following display shows our predictor is ready to servce predictions. You can now predict!

![Forecast active](pictures/generate_forecast_active.png)

## Make a prediction
Let's make a prediction from the trained predictor:
1. Press **Look up Forecast**. Then, for **Forecast**, select the name of the endpoint created earlier from the drop-down:

![Prediction lookup](pictures/prediction_lookup.png)

* *Start Date* – Enter `12/31/2014`. Leave the default time of `00:00:00`.
* *End date* – Enter `01/02/2015`. Change the time to `12:00:00`.
* Enter the ID of a client included in the initial data source data in [Value]. (Example: `client_2`)

2.　 Pressing [Get Forecast] will output the prediction as a graph as shown below:

![Prediction plot](pictures/prediction_example.png)
 
The numbers P10, P50, and P90 have a probability of 10%, 50%, and 90%, respectively, and include actual demand. It means that there is an 80% chance (90 - 10 = 80) of being within that range (below the highest value). The larger the number of PXX, the higher the probability that the prediction will fall within that value, but the blur width will increase, so we recommend using the value of P50 first.
